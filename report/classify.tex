\section{Classification}
\label{s:class}
Intuitively, we expected the regions in which each algorithm performed better to be highly nonlinear.
As a result, we chose to use a support vector machine for classification, as these are known to have good performance for nonlinear classification.
Specifically, we used MATLAB's~\shaddi{cite} implementation of SVM.
We chose to compare two kernels, the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) and the multilayer perceptron (MLP).

As described in section~\ref{s:data:gen}, we featurized DMM by using the sizes of the input matrices: M, K, and N.
The output of our classifier was the algorithm that performed better for a given tuple (M, K, N).
The classifier only considered the binary training data---we did not take into account how much better an algorithm performed at each point; we leave this weighted classification to future work.

We trained our classifier on each of our three testing machines.
Our results, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:training}, were surprising.
While we expected some machine-to-machine variation, the regions where each algorithm performs better are substantially different across machines.
Indeed, Emerald and Sandy have diametrically opposed training results.
\shaddi{Wasn't there a reason for this that you all mentioned? Would be cool to add it.}
This is a key result: approaches that do not consider per-machine variation are certain to use the wrong algorithm in many cases.
